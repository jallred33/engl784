## **Learning Outcomes**

By the end of the semester, students who have successfully completed the course will:

- Have a broad understanding of Faulkner’s life and work, with a special focus on the formal properties of his fiction and the arc of his writerly development from the 1920s to the 40s.
- Gain a context for the aesthetics and politics of Faulkner’s work, for example, its relationship to other examples of the modernist novel, its engagement with issues of race, gender, and sexuality, and its engagement with the history of the South in the Civil War and Reconstruction.
- Hone their writing skills and especially close reading/analytic skills in careful engagement with formally difficult prose.
- Learn to engage an audience of peers as well as a broader public orally and in writing, using web-based platforms such as WordPress and wikis.

## **Course Description:**
This course will examine one of the most seminal novelists of the twentieth century whose influence resonates globally, from US writers like Toni Morrison and Cormac McCarthy to postcolonial writers like Gabriel Garcia Marquez. We will think about Faulkner's place in the long development of the novel genre, but also (and especially) the way his work illuminates crucial social, economic, and political developments of the early 20th century: the long aftermath of slavery in Southern life, the gradual and uneven progress of modernization in US society, and changes in perceptions of space and time in the period. And of course we will engage the famous difficulty of Faulkner's work, discovering (or so I wager) the pleasure of the strenuous mode of reading it demands and especially of reading and discussing it with peers.

**Requirements**: faithful attendance and vigorous participation, several short informal writing assignments, a longer midterm writing project, and a final research paper of about 15 pp., or equivalent alternative project, in consultation with the instructor.

## Writing and Research Help

In addition to course assignments and instruction, the [Reading/Writing Center](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/rwc) can help you to improve your literacy skills and develop your writing style.

For research help, Hunter College Libraries provide online databases and other remote resources. Hunter librarians can help you leverage these resources for your projects. Here are some ways:

- [Five ways to contact the library](https://library.hunter.cuny.edu/ask-a-librarian)
- Contact English subject librarian Jennifer Newman at jn1314@hunter.cuny.edu. We’ll work with her later in the term.
- Instructions to access the Hunter Library from off-campus are here: https://library.hunter.cuny.edu/remote-access.

For more ways to get help, consult [Academic Support & Tutoring](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/onestop/advising/academic-support-tutoring-1).

## Attendance/Participation:

Faculty are required to certify student attendance. You are urged to keep abreast of any attendance requirements that may be set by Hunter, government agencies or others with regards to qualification for financial aid, fulltime status, etc.

Except as stipulated by Hunter policy, your course grades may be based on assignments (which may include presentations and participation in group activities) and interaction with online lectures, but not on attendance *per se*. I do expect regular, vigorous participation in our discussions and other synchronous activities.

Please do your best to contact me if you cannot take part in the course due to illness or an emergency. Let me know if you will be unable to access the course site or the internet for a week or more. Depending on the circumstances it may be possible to schedule alternatives to activities that you miss. Remember that to be excused, medicals must indicate that you were incapable of working on the assignment while confined.
