1. What do you notice about the Sartoris family? Who are its leaders, and what is its structure? How does it diverge from our expectations about families in the antebellum South?

1. One of the subplots of the second and third chapters concerns the desire of enslaved people for freedom. What are some of the ways this desire is articulated?
